# Trash Trekker - UofTHacks VI
A Trash Map for a Beautiful City

### The Challenge

Trash collecting is an inefficient process. Waste is left everywhere, finding itself in the most ridiculousness locations possible. Sometimes trash is forgotten for many years. Not only that, but after the collection process, it must be sorted manually which consumes time and resources.

### Our Solution

Using visual recognition powered by ML Kit and a suite of Google products including Firebase, Maps JS API and Maps SDK Android, garbage will no longer have a place to hide. With aerial drones and crowd-sourced data, garbage will be located, categorized and entered into a database with the snap of a photo. Access the data on one of our three platforms including a web app and two Android apps tailored for different users. Submit your photos of garbage, either in person or from live footage and our visual recognition will sort the garbage for you and geo-tag it. Locate it conveniently on a map accessible both on the web and on our two Android apps. Participate in our crowd-sourced data or use it yourself, and together we will create a beautiful city and a beautiful world
